This folder contains the distribution structure for Windows.

To get the actual SudokuGame.exe, you need to:

1. Build on a Windows machine using: python build_windows.py
2. Use GitHub Actions (see .github/workflows/build-windows.yml)
3. Use Docker with Windows container

The batch file and README are ready to use once you have the .exe file.
